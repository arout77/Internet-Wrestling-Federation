    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The IWF match simulation engine is a turn-based system designed to create realistic and dramatic match narratives. It goes beyond simple stat comparisons to simulate a match moment-by-moment, using a combination of wrestler attributes, move data, and weighted probabilities to determine the outcome. This document breaks down the key factors that influence a match.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">Understanding the Overall Rating</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
        A wrestler's Overall Rating is a quick measure of their general capabilities, but it doesn't tell the whole story.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-400 mb-6">
        <li>
            <strong>Calculation:</strong> The Overall Rating is calculated by taking a wrestler's six core attributes (Strength, Technical, Brawling, Aerial, Stamina, Toughness), discarding the single lowest score, and then averaging the remaining five.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Meaning:</strong> A high Overall Rating indicates a well-rounded wrestler with a wide skill set and thus more ways to win a match. It is a representation of their skill level in all areas combined, but does not take into account other factors such as size and weight.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Underdog Factor:</strong> Having a high Overall Rating doesn't guarantee a win. A wrestler with a lower overall rating may still be able to win if they specialize in one particular aspect of wrestling (e.g., a brawler with a high Strength stat) and can leverage that advantage during the match.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">Key Factors in Determining a Winner</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">Victory is determined by a complex interplay of the following systems:</p>

    <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. The "David vs. Goliath" Factor (Size Discrepancy)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-400">
                The difference in a wrestler's height and weight creates strategic advantages and disadvantages.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-400 mt-4">
                <li>A significant weight advantage grants a damage bonus to <strong>Strength-based</strong> moves like slams and powerbombs.</li>
                <li>A significant weight *disadvantage* grants a damage bonus to <strong>Aerial-based</strong> moves, reflecting greater agility.</li>
                <li>A smaller wrestler has a higher chance to reverse a power move, while a larger wrestler has a higher chance to "catch" a high-flyer out of the air.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">2. Stamina: The Pace of the Match</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-400">
                Stamina is the resource that dictates the match's flow. A wrestler with low stamina becomes less effective, suffering penalties to their hit chance and damage output. If a wrestler's stamina is completely depleted, they enter a "Gassed" state where their defensive capabilities are severely reduced.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Toughness: The Will to Survive</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-400">
                Toughness represents a wrestler's resilience. It acts as a direct damage reduction, meaning a wrestler with high Toughness will take less damage from every move. This stat is also a critical factor in their ability to kick out of pinfall attempts.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">4. Momentum: The Drama of the Fight</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-400">
                Momentum creates the dramatic swings of a wrestling match. It is gained by successfully landing moves and reversing attacks. The wrestler with higher momentum has a greater chance of controlling the pace of the match and being the attacker in any given turn. A full momentum bar is required to attempt a powerful Finisher.
