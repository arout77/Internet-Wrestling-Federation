            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-4">The Challenge Zone</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Ready to prove you have the best prospect in the IWF? The Challenge Zone is where you can go head-to-head with prospects created by other players.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">How it Works:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Browse Prospects:</strong> View a list of all other user-created prospects in the game. You can see their level, record, and stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Issue a Challenge:</strong> Select a prospect and set a wager amount in gold. The challenge is then sent to that player.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Challenges:</strong> On your "Manage Challenges" page, you can view challenges you've sent (pending) and challenges you've received.</li>
                <li><strong>Accept or Decline:</strong> When you receive a challenge, you can view a "Tale of the Tape," which shows your opponent's stats, the wager, and the calculated betting odds. From there, you can accept or decline.</li>
                <li><strong>The Simulation:</strong> Once a challenge is accepted, the gold is wagered and a match is simulated on the server. The winner takes the entire pot! You will be notified of the result.</li>
            </ul>
